This is just a basic code to recreate the game we have all played when we had broken internet; the famous dinosaur jumping on the chrome browser whenever a website can't load.
This is a simple code written using HTML, CSS< JavaScript. 
To run the game, make sure all the files are in the same directory and then you can access the game through the html file.
